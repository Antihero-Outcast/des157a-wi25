        <p>I plan to develop my project around the idea of archived (living) photos 
            each placed in their own fancy pod. The 5 pods can be cycled through by 
            selecting a different pod to examine, to which the entire set will 
            move like a circular conveyor belt to adapt to the interaction. In the top corner there will be a vault door exit button to exit the page.
            This new design, including the background and text, is based on 
            nostalgia. Each pod that's opened will contain one of the 5 images 
            which will have a message briefly describing their living nature and their own special animations:<br><br>
            
            Open Pod 1, Unicorn-Cat: Immediately morphs into a glowing orb and disappears so you can't see or interact with it anymore
            Open Pod 2, Doctor-Who: Using X-offset, when you move your cursor close enough to the image, it will spin (and maybe disappear)
            Open Pod 3, Loki: Opacity Immediately starts to get lower over a few seconds, when you hover over it will stop and the opactiy goes back to 100%
            Open Pod 4, LDR: A static animation of fireworks bursting around the image
            Open Pod 5, Taco Bell Dog: Click on the speech bubble and another will take its place with a new quote<br><br>
    
            I purposely made the interactions not too loaded or complex, but just enough to hammer home what the images' representations are.

    <h2>Digital Sketches</h2>

        <p>I decided to make a background with an illuminated silver metal wall and a checkered floor, 
            partially inspired by the game Fallout with the vault idea. I
            went with Bebas Neue as my main font to continue with this 
            inspiration. I wanted the design layout with the pods to be simple with a more 
            complex mechanic behind it. Working on the pods is going to take some time, so I have my drawing as a placeholder for now. I chose my pods to have an ornate design because I 
            still wanted it to represent a gallery for my images. The exit door and the greeting 
            text in the top corners are to add to a sense of immersion. I think where I've drawn my inspiration from, such as 1950s decor and the Fallout game,
            is what makes my design unique. It hammers home the nostalgia but adds a twist of mystery, which is going to be a driving force behind the interactions of my project.

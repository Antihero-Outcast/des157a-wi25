                <h2>The <span>Fun</span>damentals</h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, games are expected to balance <span>fun</span> and <span>fun</span>ctionality so players enjoy and understand them. It all starts with what 
                    game you would want to create and play, and the primary goal at that point is to figure out how to make those conceptualized 
                    ideas tangible. The how is executed, notably, by establishing core game mechanics (or rules) to guide the player from the 
                    time they push play to their completion. Where I first challenge the ideas of the article on 
                    <a href="https://www.juegostudio.com/blog/game-design-principles-every-game-designer-should-know">Game Design Principles</a> 
                    is the need for these game mechanics to be simple, and not complex. I do believe that for aspiring game designers, this is a 
                    necessity, but the ability to draw from simple, fundamental concepts and translate them into complex features is 
                    simultaneously rich and rewarding on both sides.

               <h2>The Effects</h2>
                <p>
                    With the management of creativity, logic, and a set of definitive game mechanics, game design principles are seen as a manual guide for designers 
                    to recognize what makes the player experience seamless, intuitive, and motivating (e.g., arrow icons for directional communication). I would also 
                    like to challenge here that universal design practices are sometimes meant to be rejected for isolated novel experiences. Nonetheless, players need 
                    to be at a level of difficulty where they are familiar with the basic communications and cues while continuing to be challenged further. As it is 
                    in UI/UX design, which definitely applies here, feedback and a reward system train players to follow the game's intentions, and continuously 
                    testing the prototype iterations ensures a solid design out the door. Game design is a special field, and because I'm so into the imagination 
                    behind it, I really wonder about the explicit reasons for it to be a mark of future betterment. Best believe I'll be sure to pick up Jane McGonigal's
                    <em>Reality is Broken</em> to find out more.

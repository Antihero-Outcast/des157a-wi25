            <p>
                I'm aware that overlays, or modal windows, have become a nuisance of a UI pattern to users in the form of the “dreaded popup 
                window.” To me, I think they can also be designed for immersion that fulfills the intentionality behind an interactive media's 
                inspiration. Some important points come up about best practices in <em>Medium's</em> article about overlay, modal, and dialogue 
                windows that would apply here. 
            </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Best Practices: What They Could Mean for More Creative Overlays</h2>
                <p>
                    If we continue with the latter idea of overlays, having at least the escape key button and a visible close button outside 
                    the window satisfies usability with a versatile exit strategy while still keeping the focus on immersive design. 
                    
                    When trying to get a user to do a task, having a button prompt to begin that task and a modal title to match it helps users 
                    understand where they are on a page and what action they’re supposed to take. With immersive, game-like media having a 
                    modal title wouldn’t need to be large as it’s only there to give context to the current view. Other buttons such as the 
                    close button don’t require much, in fact, just an ‘X’ suffices and can even be illustrated with artistic inspiration. 
                    
                    The sizing and location of an overlay can differ when a designer has narrative and styling intentions, meaning they don’t 
                    necessarily have to be less than 50% of the screen. However, I do believe that the purpose of an overlay is to remind the 
                    user that it still relates to the original page, and they need to visibly see that with enough marginal space for the faded 
                    opacity of some of the contents to be in view. 
                </p>
            </section>

            <p>
                All the overlay best practices mentioned in the article are universal with interactive media, but they can also vary in 
                requirement or level of freedom and creative direction.

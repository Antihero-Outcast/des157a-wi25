            <h2>Form Design Best Practices</h2>
            <p>
                I can think of 5 main principles behind form design best practices according to <em>Medium's</em> 
                “Best practices for form design” article: accessibility, interaction costs, priming, usability, and user-friendliness. 
                These seem pretty universal in web and interactive media design and always directly apply to the projects I work on in 
                this field. In my practice, I either ensure intuitive, flowing, and readable design or point out faults in these areas 
                along with a lack of contrast when I'm also trying to come up with unique, eye-catching illustrations. In upcoming 
                entries for my portfolio of work - which will include form design in the current class I'm in - the 20 points outlined 
                in the Medium article will prove useful in balancing between a checklist covering the 5 overarching best practice 
                principles I mentioned and experimenting with unique and ambitious design ideas.

            <h2>Online Form Example</h2>
            <p>
                An online form I've used before are surveys. An example that demonstrated best practices was a 5-7 minute survey to 
                create a Game Motivation Profile on <em>Quantic Foundry's</em> gaming research website. All questions were around 6 or fewer items, 
                so the fields where you click or type input were either a form of horizontal radio buttons or a vertical list of text 
                entry fields. The interface was simple and readable, including indications and prompts to help figure out what to do. 
                Other features were a percentage progress bar to help indicate how far you were in the longer-form survey and auto-fill 
                popups as you're typing in your entry. It's pretty neat and flowing in usability.

                <h2>Experience with Visual Thinking</h2>
                <p>
                    Much of what the NY Times's article illustrates with visual thinking and analysis is what I remember doing back in high school. 
                    Questions about what you find in the image, the details that make you think that, and anything else you notice very much guide 
                    the discussions and are answered in different orders and novel explanations. That level of versatility strengthens the ability 
                    to practice visual thinking. The more I read through the article, the more I remember how much I live under a rock as I try to 
                    decipher the images provided for inference. I have an eye for detail, but I also realize that global knowledge is part of the 
                    experience by familiarizing yourself with different perspectives and worlds within one image. It demonstrates that photos 
                    include intentional details for people to find and present a perspective that someone will understand or want to learn about.

                <h2>Image and Interaction Analysis: Strengths and Drawbacks</h2>
                <p>
                    I looked at the <em>Lacoste Member's Experience</em> website, which had interactive animations of highly rendered images of shirts. 
                    There's a lot of novelty and power behind using your mouse to move the shirt around with its textures flowing reactively and 
                    the visual feedback from the background. The issue with it, however, is that there's so much high graphical fidelity that it 
                    causes loading to process these images, affecting user engagement. At one point while the website was loading (the loading 
                    screen was neat) I was ready to quit because of how long it initially took for me to arrive at the website. Also, in creation 
                    mode when choosing between different shirts as a base it took loading time to switch between them, which is slightly annoying.

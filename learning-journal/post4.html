                <h2>Exchanging Images</h2>
                <p>
                    This is my classmate Catelyn's image of her cat Mochi. She took the picture with her Polaroid a little while back. 
                    I think one of the most interesting aspects of this image is that it's a Polaroid because it feels organic, like a memory 
                    or moment captured in time. The reflection of light from the cat's eyes is a mysterious enhancement, an obvious contrast 
                    to the darkened background which brings the viewers to what the primary focus is supposed to be. An idea to push the 
                    visual richness of the image is to have the entire polaroid object in the frame and a place where it's laid or mounted. 
                    This would compose one picture with added narrative output for the viewer to examine, like why the polaroid is placed where 
                    it is, and what relation that location has to the polaroid that was taken. It's one small change added for an even more 
                    compelling picture.

                <h2>My Current Image Muse</h2>
                <p>
                    This image is interesting because it was the first or second poster I got when I was little. There's a lot of history 
                    evident in the etched marks of the poster, which can't be seen from the distance the picture was taken and the glare. The 
                    image relates to my collection of posters since childhood, and I've done more with them than just mount them on my walls. 
                    The collection tells a story of when and how I got these posters, what I was doing around that time, what I ended up using 
                    them for, and how they felt “me.” I think I would update my images by showing where and how they're mounted, and with less 
                    glare so the finer details can shine through. In this picture, I took off the medals hanging on the top corner thumbtacks 
                    holding up the poster, so I think letting them stay where they are will add more authenticity to my narrative.
